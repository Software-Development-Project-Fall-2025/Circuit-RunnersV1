# Circuit Runners - Game Server

This is the server component for the Circuit Runners game, handling multiplayer functionality and game state management.

## Features

- Real-time multiplayer support using WebSockets
- Web-based game hosting
- Shareable game links
- Local development support
- Easy deployment

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Docker
- Windows (WSL)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd Server
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Run locally (testing)

1) Install dependencies (first time only)

```bash
npm install
```

2) Start the dev server (auto-restart on changes)

```bash
npm run dev
```

3) Open the lobby

- http://localhost:3000
- Create a game to get a shareable link, or join by entering a Room ID

4) Open the game page directly (useful for testing)

- http://localhost:3000/game?room=ROOM_ID&name=YourName
- Before the Unity build is exported, a placeholder page will load and still join/create the room so you can test networking and links.

Notes

- The server listens on port 3000 by default. To change it, set `PORT` before starting.
- To run without nodemon: `npm start`
- Health check endpoint: http://localhost:3000/health

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server root with the following variables:

```
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## Game Integration

### Connecting from Unity

1. Build your Unity game for WebGL
2. Place the built files in the `public/game` directory (this will replace the placeholder)
3. The game will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/game`

Unity WebGL export steps (checklist)

1) In Unity, switch Platform to WebGL (File → Build Settings → WebGL → Switch Platform)
2) Player Settings (Project Settings → Player → WebGL)
   - Resolution and Presentation: Template = Default (or your custom)
   - Publishing Settings:
     - Compression Format = Brotli (recommended) or Gzip
     - Decompression Fallback = Enabled (optional; helps on hosts without proper encodings)
     - Data Caching = Enabled
     - Threads = Disabled unless your host supports COOP/COEP
3) Build
   - Build folder target: `Server/public/game/`
   - Unity will write `index.html` and a `Build/` folder into `Server/public/game/`
4) Verify output
   - `Server/public/game/index.html` (Unity-generated)
   - `Server/public/game/Build/*.data(.br)`, `*.framework.js(.br)`, `*.wasm(.br)`
5) WebGL JS bridge (for URL + messaging)
   - Custom bridge already added at: `CircuitRunners/Assets/Plugins/WebGL/NetworkBridge.jslib`
   - In WebGL builds, your C# calls to `GetURLParameter` and `SendNetworkMessageWebGL` will bind to window functions defined on the page.

Unity WebGL export tips

- Expected output under `Server/public/game/`:
  - `index.html` (Unity-generated; safe to overwrite the placeholder)
  - `Build/YourBuild.data`, `Build/YourBuild.framework.js`, `Build/YourBuild.wasm` (plus `.br`/`.gz` if compression is enabled)
- Recommended Player Settings for the web
  - Compression: Brotli or Gzip (both are served as static files here)
  - WebAssembly: enabled
  - Threads: keep disabled unless your deployment host supports COOP/COEP headers
- Join link format for testing or sharing
  - `http(s)://<host-or-ip>:<port>/game?room=<ROOM_ID>&name=<YourName>`

### WebSocket Connection

Use the following code in your Unity game to connect to the server:

```csharp
using SocketIOClient;

// Initialize the client
var client = new SocketIO("http://localhost:3000");

// Connect to the server
await client.ConnectAsync();

// Join a game
await client.EmitAsync("joinGame", new { playerName = "Player1", roomId = "room123" });

// Listen for game updates
client.On("gameState", response => {
    var gameState = response.GetValue<GameState>();
    // Update game state
});

// Send game updates
await client.EmitAsync("gameUpdate", new {
    // Your game state here
});
```

## Deploy to the web (self-hosted, WebSockets)

This server is ready to be self-hosted and exposes real-time multiplayer via Socket.IO (WebSockets). You have two common options:

Option A — Single container (simple)

From the `Server/` directory:

```bash
# 1) Build the image (ensure your Unity build is already in Server/public/game/)
docker build -t circuit-runners-server .

# 2) Run the container (maps host port 3000)
docker run --name circuit-runners -p 3000:3000 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e CORS_ORIGIN="http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:3000" \
  circuit-runners-server
```

PowerShell note (Windows): use backticks for multi-line commands, not backslashes. Example:

```powershell
docker run --name circuit-runners -p 3000:3000 `
  -e NODE_ENV=production `
  -e CORS_ORIGIN="http://localhost:3000" `
  circuit-runners-server
```

If you see `docker: invalid reference format`, it typically means the line breaks were not escaped correctly. Run it as a single line or use PowerShell backticks as shown above.

Visit:

- Lobby: `http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:3000`
- Game: `http://YOUR_HOSTNAME_OR_IP:3000/game?room=ROOM_ID&name=YourName`

Option B — Docker Compose + Nginx reverse proxy (recommended for HTTPS)

Files provided:

- `Server/docker-compose.yml`
- `Server/deploy/nginx.conf`

Steps:

```bash
# 1) Ensure Unity build is in Server/public/game/
# 2) (Optional) Edit deploy/nginx.conf for your server_name and TLS if terminating HTTPS at Nginx
# 3) Start both services
docker compose up -d

# 4) Test over HTTP
curl http://localhost/health
```

If you add TLS to Nginx:

- Terminate HTTPS at Nginx and proxy to `app:3000`
- Set header `X-Forwarded-Proto https` (see nginx.conf comments)
- In `server.js`, `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` is already enabled so the app respects proxy headers
- Set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your https origin (e.g., `https://games.example.com`)

CORS & security notes

- In development, CORS is `*`. In production, set `CORS_ORIGIN` to your exact site origin.
- Ensure your reverse proxy supports WebSocket upgrades for `/socket.io/` (configured in `deploy/nginx.conf`).

LAN testing (on your network)

1) Allow inbound connections on the server’s port in your OS firewall
2) Have teammates connect to `http://<your-local-ip>:3000`
3) Join links will work on LAN as well: `http://<your-local-ip>:3000/game?room=...&name=...`

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure the server is running and accessible from the client
- **CORS Errors**: Verify that the client is making requests to the correct server URL
- **Socket.IO Version Mismatch**: Make sure the Socket.IO client version in Unity matches the server version
